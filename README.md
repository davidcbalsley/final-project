# Food Bank Project

The Food Bank Project is a mobile-first app that implements a paperless registration process for mobile food pantries.

### Purpose

Food banks have responded to increased demand by serving clients through drive-up mobile sites: people who need food can drive to a particular location, where workers and volunteers will load bagged groceries into their backseats or trunks.

As drivers arrive at these sites, they provide some basic information: their name, address, and number of people in their household. In many cases, this means a driver fills out a paper form, or signs a shared check-in sheet, then hands that paperwork to a volunteer.

The Food Bank Project app implements a paperless registration process, both for the sake of efficiency and to limit exposure between clients and pantry workers and volunteers.

### User Story

As a manager of a food pantry, I want to provide workers and volunteers with a means for collecting information outside of paper forms, so that pantry sites can serve clients as quickly as possible and so that I can help to minimize my workersâ€™ exposure to COVID-19.
